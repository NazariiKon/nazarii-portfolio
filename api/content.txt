HEADLINE
Computer Science student at Dublin City University and full-stack developer focused on building production-style web apps and APIs.

PROFILE (ABOUT ME)
I'm a Computer Science student at Dublin City University (expected graduation May 2028) with strong foundations in data structures, algorithms, and software design.
I build full-stack applications using React/Next.js/TypeScript on the frontend and FastAPI/.NET/ASP.NET Core on the backend, usually with PostgreSQL/Supabase.
I have real team experience from a full-stack internship where I shipped features, integrated REST APIs, and fixed production bugs in an Agile workflow.
I'm motivated, reliable, and I enjoy learning new technologies while writing clean, maintainable code.
I'm authorized to work in Ireland with valid documentation.
